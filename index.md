### Dynamic Layout with CSS Flexbox

**Purpose:**

This code demonstrates how to create a dynamic layout using CSS Flexbox. The layout consists of three main sections:

* **Header:** A fixed-height section at the top.
* **Content:** A flexible-height section that automatically adjusts to its content and includes a scrollbar if necessary.
* **Footer:** A fixed-height section at the bottom.

**How it works:**

* The `body` element is the main container with fixed dimensions and relative positioning.
* The `head` and `foot` elements have fixed heights and do not scroll due to `flex-shrink: 0`.
* The `content` element dynamically adjusts its height based on its content and includes a scrollbar when needed due to `overflow-y: auto`.

**Key Features:**

* Uses CSS Flexbox for layout.
* Dynamically adjusts content height based on content.
* Includes a scrollbar for the content section when necessary.
* Maintains a fixed height for header and footer.

**Potential Use Cases:**

* Creating layouts with headers, content, and footers.
* Building responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

**Customization:**

* Adjust the dimensions and styles of the elements to fit your specific needs.
* Experiment with different flexbox properties to achieve desired layout behaviors.
