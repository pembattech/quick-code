# Interactive Date Input Toggler

This HTML document demonstrates an interactive date input toggler. It allows users to switch between a text input field and a date input field with a single click, making it more user-friendly for date selection.

## Description

The interactive date input toggler consists of two input fields:

1. **Text Input Field**: Initially, a text input field is displayed. Users can manually type the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

2. **Date Input Field**: When the text input field is clicked (focused), it transforms into a date input field where users can select a date from a date picker.

## Usage

To use this interactive date input toggler, follow these steps:

1. Include the provided HTML code in your web page.

2. Customize the `id`, `name`, and `placeholder` attributes as needed.

3. Ensure that the PHP code retrieves the desired start date. You can replace the example date (`$startDate = "2023-09-30";`) with dynamic data from your database or source.

4. Users can click the text input field to switch to the date input field and select a date. When they click outside the date input field, it switches back to the text input field, displaying the selected date.
